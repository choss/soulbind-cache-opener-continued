# Soulbind Cache Opener Continued

This addon is a continuation of https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/soulbind-cache-opener since it was not updated since 2023. All credits go to the original author known as https://www.curseforge.com/members/nerino1

This addon provides an easy way to open various rewards found in Dragonflight and Shadowlands.
You will no longer need to search through your bags for Dragon Isle Knowledge, Drake Customizations, Cache Rewards and more.
As well as Adventurer Caches, Callings rewards or rewards from your Soulbind in Shadowlands

This addon will create a movable button that only appears when you have something to open. If you have multiple items to open, there will be a new button for each type.

The button is movable by dragging with the Right Mouse Button.
Type /soulbindcacheopener reset OR /sco reset to reset the button position
